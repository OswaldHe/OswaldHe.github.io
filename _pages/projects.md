**WeBuy**(March.2020 – June.2020):

A software constructed for people to search for nearest supermarkets that has inventory of groceries they want. As a full-stack engineer, I used React Native as the Framework to build mobile app UI and NodeJS Express as backend framework.

- Implement content-based recommendation algorithm on supermarkets that fit users’ preference
- Provide optimum solution for user to buy a list of groceries using Simulated Annealing algorithm
- Implement a shopping list management system for users’ convenience while buying.
- Use Google Map API to generate a list of supermarkets near users
- Use Redux to control the states between different UI components

(under construction)
