**UCLA Micro-Nano Manufacturing Lab** (Oct.2020 – Present)

Build GUI for Electrowetting chip controller and elaborate Edrop website for chip manufacturing. As a  student Researcher, I built the EWOD GUI, which is a PWA built on top of a normal React Web App with <span style="color:#ffbd42">*serviceWorker*</span>. I also improved the Edrop website using <span style="color:#ffbd42">*React+JQuery*</span> as frontend tech stack and Loopback as backend framework.

- Improve Edrop Website frontend and <span style="color:#ffbd42">*MySQL*</span> database design.
- Utilize service worker with React to build PWA for GUI, with <span style="color:#ffbd42">*IndexedDB*</span> for file saving.
- Use <span style="color:#ffbd42">*WebHID*</span> api to access the EWOD controller HID and perform read-write operations.
- Create user interface for drawing electrodes with Material UI and test with *Jest + Testing-library*.
- Use <span style="color:#ffbd42">*Cypress*</span> for end-to-end testing.
