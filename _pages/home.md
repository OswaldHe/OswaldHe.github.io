I'm currently a **third year Computer Science and Applied Mathematics** student at the 
**University of California, Los Angeles**. I have at least two years non-professional experience
in Software Engineering, including Frontend/Backend development, Database management and design,
and code testing. I'm working at **Duolingo** for 2021 Summer SWE internship, specifically working
for DET(*Duolingo English Test*). At school, I worked at DevX as a backend engineer for database migration(mongoDB to DynamoDB) and as a full-stack engineer for an external project
([Saru Recycling](https://www.sarurecycling.com/about)). As a student researcher, I worked at UCLA 
[Micro Nano Manufacture Lab](https://www.cjkimlab.ucla.edu) for developing GUI for EWOD chips and improving microchip purchasing website [Edrop](https://edrops.org/home).
